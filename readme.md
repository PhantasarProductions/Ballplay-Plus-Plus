BallPlay was a game I once wrote as a teenager, inspired by Lemmings. As drawing an animating was with the stuff I had back then not really an option I replaced the lemmings with balls, I also made it topdown view and came up with more changes to make the game more suitable and BallPlay was born.

I made many instalments over the years. First for DOS (all those games are written in Turbo Pascal), later for Windows (In BlitzBasic, BlitzMax and Lua, respectively).

Now many BallPlay games were lost on me (unfortunately), and I decided to bundle all the BallPlay games I could still find togehter in BallPlay++ (in which ++ is a reference to the fact that this new game was entirely coded in C++).

Should I ever find some old versions of BallPlay that I didn't yet put in BallPlay++ (and their respective source codes, as I will need to entirely break down the system in which the puzzles were written in order to convert them to BallPlay++).

Now Windows will be my primary target for now, however should I be able to find ways to make a version for Linux and WASM too, I will certainly consider that. (MacOS, and iOS are out of the question due to their strict AppStore policy. If you wanna port this game to Mac yourself, go ahead, I won't stop you. The source code is GPL3 licensed anyway).



Current status: In development!
